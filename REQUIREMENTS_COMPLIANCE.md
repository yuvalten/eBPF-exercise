# Requirements Compliance - REAL Cilium Framework eBPF Solution

This document demonstrates how our solution meets **ALL** requirements from the README exercise using the **REAL Cilium framework** (`github.com/cilium/ebpf`).

## ‚úÖ Complete Requirements Fulfillment

### 1. **Create an eBPF program** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `ebpf_probe.c` - Complete eBPF program with kprobes
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 2. **eBPF programs should use the Cilium framework; eBPF code should be in C** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: Uses **REAL Cilium framework**:
  - `github.com/cilium/ebpf` Go library for user space
  - `bpf2go` tool for automatic Go bindings generation
  - High-level Cilium APIs for program loading, map management, and event handling
  - C eBPF code with CO-RE support via `vmlinux.h`
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED with **REAL Cilium framework**

### 3. **eBPF should be generated as part of the build flow** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `Makefile` automatically:
  - Compiles C eBPF program with CO-RE support
  - Runs `go generate` to create Go bindings with `bpf2go`
  - Builds Go user space program using Cilium framework
  - Links everything together
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 4. **eBPF program should be able to probe, using kprobes for both sys_read and sys_write kernel functions** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - `SEC("kprobe/__x64_sys_read")` - hooks into sys_read kernel function
  - `SEC("kprobe/__x64_sys_write")` - hooks into sys_write kernel function
  - Both kprobes are automatically attached by Go user space program using Cilium's `link.Kprobe`
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 5. **Expected result: Every time a call to sys_read and sys_write on the Linux machine it runs on, the eBPF program will print "hello sys_read/sys_write was called"** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - eBPF program captures every syscall
  - Sends events to user space via Cilium's perf buffer
  - Go user space program prints exactly: "hello sys_read was called" or "hello sys_write was called"
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 6. **Output: Log file** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - Creates `syscalls.log` file
  - Logs every syscall event with timestamp and process details
  - File is automatically created and appended to
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 7. **Screen user space print - do not rely on "/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe"** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - Go user space program (`cilium_probe`) prints to screen
  - Uses Cilium's perf events, NOT trace_pipe
  - Output: "hello sys_read was called" / "hello sys_write was called"
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 8. **Provide eBPF as well as the user space code** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - `ebpf_probe.c` - Complete C eBPF program
  - `cilium_ebpf_probe.go` - Complete Go user space program using Cilium framework
  - Both are fully functional and tested
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 9. **Provide instructions for installation/running it** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - `INSTALL.md` - Complete installation guide
  - `Makefile` with `make install-deps` target for Go and Cilium dependencies
  - `make help` shows usage instructions
  - `make test` for automated testing
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 10. **Be able to pass configuration information from the user space code to the eBPF program** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - `config_map` BPF map for configuration
  - Go user space sets `verbose` flag and custom `message`
  - eBPF program reads configuration via Cilium's map management
  - Example: Configuration passed through `objs.ConfigMap.Update()`
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 11. **Be able to pass some information from the eBPF program to the user space code** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: 
  - `events` perf buffer for data transfer
  - eBPF sends: `pid`, `tgid`, `comm`, `func_name`, `timestamp`
  - Go user space receives via Cilium's `perf.NewReader`
  - Real-time event streaming from kernel to user space
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

## üöÄ REAL Cilium Framework Benefits Demonstrated

### **Automatic Go Bindings Generation**
- `bpf2go` tool generates Go structs and functions from C eBPF code
- Type-safe interfaces between Go and eBPF
- Automatic handling of C structs and arrays

### **High-Level eBPF Management**
- `ebpf.CollectionSpec` for program specifications
- `ebpf.Program` for loaded programs
- `ebpf.Map` for map operations
- `link.Kprobe` for kprobe attachment

### **Go Integration Benefits**
- Native Go development experience
- Strong typing and compile-time checks
- Automatic memory management with `defer`
- Comprehensive error handling

### **Professional-Grade Event Processing**
- `perf.NewReader` for efficient event consumption
- Type-safe event parsing from eBPF to Go
- Real-time syscall monitoring with Cilium's high-performance APIs
